[1] The **ON-OFF-DRL-main** repo contains ready implementation on the ORAN dataset for Resource Allocation. It provides a performance analysis of two DRL algorithms (PPO and ACER).


[2] The **deep-rl-main** contains the implementation of several other learning algorithms.


[3] The **spinningup_in_pytorch-master** contains the implementation of several other learning algorithms.


Currently working on embedding the _DDPG algorithm_ from [2] and _TD3 algorithm_ from [3] into repo [1].
