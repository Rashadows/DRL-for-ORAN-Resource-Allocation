The **ON-OFF-DRL-main** repo contains ready implementation on the ORAN dataset for Resource Allocation. It provides a comparative analysis of two DRL algorithms (PPO and ACER).


The **deep-rl-main** contains the implementation of several other learning algorithms to be implemented and contrasted.


Currently working on embedding the _DDPG algorithm_
