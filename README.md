[1] The **ON-OFF-DRL-main** repo contains ready implementation on the ORAN dataset for Resource Allocation. It provides a performance analysis of two DRL algorithms (PPO and ACER).

[2] The **openAI_pytorch_drl_algo-master** contains the implementation of several other learning algorithms.

Currently working on embedding the _DDPG algorithm_ from and _TD3 algorithm_ from [2] into repo [1].
