----------Potential Bugs:

In greedy.py----------
return np.random.choice(m_cpu[1]) generates a random sample from the range 0 to the server of lowest cpu

In opt.py----------
result = v.varName[2] gives the second char defined in addVar(name="x_" + str(i)), so result='_' not int

----------Notes:

uncomment and work out the annotation point in reward plot file for convergence points
